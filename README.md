- On browser window load, there is a async call to two endpoints.
- The call will retry if an error is encountered
- On success, data is rendered to 3 containers. Data is also logged to the console.
- The data is filtered to according to user preference of search.
- There is 3 buttons to toggle with filtered data sections
- Click on the desired filter followed by the course you require. 
- Confirm with the window prompt and the course is added to your list/cart

```

## Design/ Method Motivation
  
 ``` 
- Given the short time frame, scope of works and minimal dependendencies required, i decided to use plain JavaScript and no frameworks.
- I styled the application with standard CSS and Boostrap 4.
- I utilised Underscore JS library to organise my retrived data arrays according to my UI serach parameters
- I utilised Jquery for an onscroll header effect and basic effects from user egagement focus points.
- Course data selected is pushed to an array 'list' and can take hold multiple courses selected by the user. 
- All process steps are logged to console for debugging/view

```
