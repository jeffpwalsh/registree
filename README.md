## Working Guide
  
 ``` 
- On browser window load, there is a async call to two endpoints.
- The async call will continuously retry if an error is encountered.
- On success, data is rendered to 3 containers. Data is also logged to the console.
- The data is filtered according to user preferences for the UI criteria.
- There is 3 buttons to toggle filtered data sections with.
- You can click on the desired filter, followed by the course you require in the rendered course list. 
- Confirm your course with the window prompt, and the course is added to a list/cart.

```

## Design/ Method Motivation
  
 ``` 
- Given the short time frame, scope of works and minimal dependendencies required, i decided to use plain JavaScript and no frameworks.
- I styled the application with standard CSS and Boostrap 4.
- I utilised Underscore JS library to organise my retrived data arrays, according to my UI serach parameters.
- I utilised jQuery for an onscroll header effect, as well as basic effects from user egagement point of view.
- The course data selected is pushed to an array 'list' and can hold multiple courses selected by the user. 
- All process steps are logged to console for debugging/view.
